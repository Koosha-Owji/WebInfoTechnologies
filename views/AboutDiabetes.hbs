        <h1> <font size="+2"> <b>What is Diabetes?</b></font></h1> <br>
        <p> Diabetes is a chronic (long-lasting) health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy.
            Most of the food you eat is broken down into sugar (also called glucose) and released into your bloodstream. When your blood sugar goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin. Insulin acts like a key to let the blood sugar into your body’s cells for use as energy.
            If you have diabetes, your body either doesn’t make enough insulin or can’t use the insulin it makes as well as it should. When there isn’t enough insulin or cells stop responding to insulin, too much blood sugar stays in your bloodstream. Over time, that can cause serious health problems, such as heart disease, vision loss, and kidney disease.
            There isn’t a cure yet for diabetes, but losing weight, eating healthy food, and being active can really help. Taking medicine as needed, getting diabetes self-management education and support, and keeping health care appointments can also reduce the impact of diabetes on your life.
        </p>
        <br>
            
            <h1> <font size="+2"> <b>What are the different types of diabetes?</b></font></h1> <br>
            <p>There are different types of diabetes; all types are complex and serious. The three main types of diabetes are type 1, type 2 and gestational diabetes. Less common types include monogenic diabetes, which is an inherited form of diabetes, and cystic fibrosis-related diabetes.
            </p> <br>
            <h1> <font size="+2"> <b>When should you watch out for diabetes?</b></font></h1> <br>
            <p>In type 1 diabetes, symptoms are often sudden and can be life-threatening; therefore it is usually diagnosed quite quickly. In type 2 diabetes, many people have no symptoms at all, while other signs can go unnoticed being seen as part of ‘getting older’.
                Therefore, by the time symptoms are noticed, complications of diabetes may already be present.
            </p><br>
            <h1> <font size="+2">Common symptoms include:</font></h1>
